This is an Excersice to try to re-implement most of the Js features on my own. 

The Goal of this Excercise is to better understand JavaScript and TypeScript for that reason I'll be using TypeScript to re-implement the Js features I choose to reimplement. 
A secondary Goal of this proyect is to learn data Structures and practice OOP, so I'll be implementing all the Data Structures that doesn't exist in JavaScript with an OOP aproach.
As a Thid Goal of this proyect, I'll be learning to do Testing with Jest, So I'll be building (at least) unit tests for all the function. One Test for every requisit to test.
